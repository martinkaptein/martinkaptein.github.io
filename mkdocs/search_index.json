Large images take an extremely long time to process, but can also provide really beautiful results.\n\n\nAlso, the size of the \nDream stuff\n doesn't scale with the image (probably depends on the trained model).\n\n\nIntrestingly enough, images with clouds tend to be most interesting. Humans do also tend to interpret different things when looking at clouds, so that's a nice parallel.\n\n\nMy results\n\n\nHere are some of my favourite results I got:\n\n\n\n\nDefault settings\n\n\nThis is done, basically with the default settings of Google (but used \n98 iterations\n)\n\n\nmake_step(net, step_size=1.5, end='inception_4c/output', jitter=32, clip=True, objective=objective_L2)\n\ndeepdream(net, base_img, iter_n=11, octave_n=4, octave_scale=1.4, \n          end='inception_4c/output', clip=True, **step_params)\n\n\n\n\n\nLayer: end='inception_4b/output'\n\n\nWhilst you can see in the first image more or less complete dogs, here it's more ears and eyes. This makes sense, as it's a 'lower level layer'.\n\n\n\n\nLayer: end='inception_5a/output'\n\n\nThis yields a very abstract result. Probably my favourite. This particular picture \nused 123 iterations\n (more on that later).\n\n\n\n\nLayer: end='inception_5b/output'\n\n\nWell, I leave this one to you.\n\n\nNote: I had to down-scale these images, so that this site loads a bit faster :P I hope that's ok\n\n\nModifications to the source code\n\n\nThe only modification I made was to 're-dream' every image (quite a large number of times).\n\n\nThis helps to get a more vivid result.\n\n\nHere is the script I made (it saves every iteration, so you can make a nice .gif or something later). Also, it doesn't crash due to memory issues.\n\n\n\nfor i in xrange(somenumber):\n    frame = deepdream(net, frame)\n    PIL.Image.fromarray(np.uint8(frame)).save(\noutput/%04d.jpg\n%frame_i)\n    frame = np.float32(PIL.Image.open('output/%04d.jpg'%frame_i))\n    frame_i += 1\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nI personally like this topic very much.

This will become the main page of the blog (or site).\n\n\nI recommend to change the links for the social networks. Feel free to adjust everything to your liking except for the \n$InsertLatestPostBelow\n tag.

            "text": "July 7, 2017\n\n\nBy \nMartin Kaptein\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of Sergei Rachmaninoff's Etude-Tableaux Op. 39 No. 5\n\n\nBefore I begin\n\n\nThis blog post will be dedicated to Sergei Rachmaninoff and his Etude Tableaux Op.39 No.5. I recommend to listen to it \nhere\n (performance by Ashkenazy), before you read this analysis. \n\n\nAlso, this analysis is quite subjective and might contain information which is not entirely correct (just a disclaimer).\n\n\n\n\nMaestro Sergei Rachmaninoff\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nThe \nEtude - Tableaux Op. 39 No.5 (in E flat minor)\n is a virtuoso etude by \nSergei Rachmaninoff\n, from the second collection of his Etudes Tableaux (the first being Op. 33), written in 1917. It combines an harmonically very dense texture with very lyrical, sometimes \nScriabin-esque melodies\n.\n\n\nBoth, op. 33 and op. 39 contain nine etudes. \n\n\nThe title \n\u201cEtude-Tableaux\u201d\n translates to \u201cpicture etude\u201d, which points to a programmatic content of the etudes. \n\n\nHowever, Rachmaninoff did not reveal any program, to be associated with the music. His words are: \n\n\n\n\n\u201cI do not believe in the artist disclosing too much of his images. Let them paint for themselves what it most suggests\u201d \n\n\n\n\nStill, he gave away some of the \u201cpictures\u201d to \nOttorino Resphighi, who orchestrated some of the etudes tableaux\n.\n\n\nCombined with the high level of difficulty associated with the \nEtudes-Tableaux\n, the possibility is considerable that Rachmaninoff was inspired by the \nTranscendental Etudes by Franz Liszt\n, which offer similar characteristics to those stated above.\n\n\nThe Etudes Tableaux (op. 33 or op. 39) are unified in a way which makes them, when performed together, very effective (for a concert). This is because of melodic connection, such as the reference to the \nDies Irae\n (such as in \nOp. 39 No. 2\n in the left hand), and the differences in character (i.e. pictures).\n\n\nThis process of unification is also the case in the, earlier composed, \n\u201cMoment musicaux\u201d Op.16\n and can also be compared to the \nTranscendental Etudes by Liszt\n or the \nSymphonic Etudes by Robert Schumann\n.\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\nThe Etude Tableaux Op.39 No.5 in E flat minor is the largest etude of Op.39 and has an ABA Form. However, on closer examination it appears to actually \nresemble a miniature Sonata Form\n.\n\n\nThe etude is marked \nAppassionato\n and features a very dense texture with long melodic lines, which need to be brought up and phrased.\n\n\nThe first theme appears from Bar 1 until Bar 12 and is marked \nmolto marcato\n. It has a very \nlyrical melody\n and is very song-like. At the same time it features and accompaniment of repeated chords in triplets. Until Bar 12 the harmony stays basically the same (E flat minor with small deviations).\n\n\nAfter Bar 11 starts an elaboration of the first theme which is introduced by a D flat 7 (11) chord in Bar 12. This chord is very special as it will also appear in the coda (3rd last bar). \n\n\nGenerally speaking, Rachmaninoff makes frequent use of a Dom 7 chord (with different options or suspension functions) on the (flattened) 7th grade in minor, such as in \nOp. 39 No. 8\n (solving thereafter to the 1st grade).\n\n\n\n\nThe Dflat 7 (11) chord, marking the start of the harmonic developement of the first theme\n\n\nAfter Bar 12 there is a lot of \nchromatic and diatonic movement\n (base in bar 12 and following as well as inner voices in Bar 18 and following). This movement leads to the first climax in Bar 22. After Bar 22 there is a transition to the second theme, which starts in Bar 26.\n\n\nThe second theme is very contrasting to the first. It has a much quieter melody, \nwhich is much more contrapuntal\n (as several voices appear at the same time) and is accompanied by \nwidespread arpeggiated chords\n in the left hand. \n\n\nIn Bar 33 and following there is, again, diatonic movement which gradually increases its intensity. For example, in Bar 26 the second theme starts in a B flat major/minor environment (which is the dominant of E flat), in Bar 33 there appears C major, in Bar 35 D major, Bar 37 E major etc.\n\n\nThis tonal (sometimes even modal) movement creates a lot of \ndifferent sound colours\n, which makes it, in a way, very similar to \nScriabin\n.\n\n\nIn Bar 43 and following appears an elaboration, in which Rachmaninoff puts the first and second theme together: While the first theme (slightly altered) appears in the top voice, in the base appears a descending whole - tone scale (hexatonic scale). Then this element is sequenced several times, leading to the second climax in Bar 47. After that there is a transition (Bar 51) to the recapitulation (which starts in Bar 54). \n\n\n\n\nCombination of first theme, second theme and hexatonic scale\n\n\nThe recapitulation features, again, the first theme, with a different accompaniment. The chord pattern in the right hand hides a reference to the \ndies irae\n (Gregorian chant), which I mentioned in the beginning. This leads to the main climatic point of the piece in Bar 61. \n\n\n\n\nThe Recapitulation and the reference to Dies Irae\n\n\nAfter that there is a transition to the second theme, which, this time, appears in E - flat minor/major in Bar 74.\n\n\nFrom this point on it stays in a E flat major and minor environment, except Bar 81 in which a \nD flat 7 (9, 13)\n chord appears. The thin texture of the coda leads to a quiet ending in E-flat major (Picardy third).\n\n\nForm\n\n\nOp. 39 No. 5 can also be interpreted in a \nminiature Sonata Form\n:\n\n\n\n\nExposition:  Bars 1 - 33\n\n\nDevelopment: Bars 33 - 54\n\n\nRecapitulation: 54 - end\n\n\n\n\nRespectively, the Exposition features the first theme in E-flat minor, its harmonic and motific  elaboration and the second theme in the Dominant (B-flat).\n\n\nThe Development features the elaboration of the second theme and the merging of elements from the first and second theme. During the transition to the Recapitulation even a \nDominantfl\u00e4che\n (pedal point on the Dominant) takes place, which is frequently associated with classical sonatas by Mozart and (early) Beethoven.\n\n\nThe Recapitulation features again the main theme (E flat minor) with the motif deviated from the \ndies irae\n in the right hand, the main climax and the second theme, this time, in E flat minor (or major respectively). This, finally, transitions in to the coda.\n\n\nHence, this etude has a structure, which is very similar to a classical sonata, but in a very compact form.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nThe Etude-Tableaux op 39 no 5 is a very challenging piece, both technically, musically and emotionally. \n\n\nIt has, alongside the other etudes, a very deep meaning, which is, ultimately, not depictable by words. In my opinion it gives, in a sense, very deep insight into the human soul. \n\n\nMaybe op.39 no.5 and the other etudes too, are meant to show certain states of mind or emotions. \nAt this point, it is worth noting that, in his youth, Rachmaninoff did suffer from depression and his etudes-tableaux could be an emotional mirror to the past. \n\n\nPerhaps it is a good thing that Rachmaninoff did not supply a programme and leaves the interpretation to the performer and listener. \n\n\nAlso, out of all etudes tableaux, op.39 no.5 is the, perhaps, most harmonically elaborate piece, featuring complex harmonic movement. \n\n\nActually, this chromatic, diatonic and modal harmonic movement, so clearly present, especially in this etude, distantly reminds me of the \nVocalise op. 34 no. 14\n (click \nhere\n to listen to it), which is another one of the many, fantastic, compositions of Sergei Rachmaninoff.",

Furthermore, there is a chance that not all information is correct (depends somewhat on your definition of 'correct'), so you have been warned.\n\n\nAlong with Beethoven\u2019s Hammerklavier and Schubert\u2019s Wanderer Fantasie, the B minor Sonata of Franz Liszt is, with its duration of about 30 minutes one of the, technically and musically most difficult and elaborate Piano Sonata composition of the 19th century.\n\n\nHistoric context\n\n\nThe sonata was published in the spring of 1854 (performed \u201957) and dedicated to Robert Schumann. Liszt meant this as a reciprocal gesture to Schumann in response to his being the dedicatee of the latter\u2019s Fantasy in C major (1839), a work that Liszt described as sublime.\n\n\nHowever, Schumann never knew of the B Minor Sonata\u2019s existence since by the time a copy of the newly published work arrived at the Schumann\u2019s home in May, 1854, Schumann was already at the asylum at Endenich.\n\n\nPossible meanings of the Sonata\n\n\nThere are some theories about the meaning of the Sonata, although, intrestingly enough, Liszt never said anything about any programmatic context.\n\n\nHere are some popular theories:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sonata is a musical portrait of the Faust legend (by G\u00f6the) with themes and motifs of Faust, Gretchen and Mephistopheles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sonata has autobiographical content\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example for the latter is Liszt\u2019s relationship with the Princess Carolyne von Sayn-Wittgenstein, his mistress for thirteen years at Weimar and close friend for the better part of half of a century (with themes and motifs of Liszt and Carolyne).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe juxtaposition of good and evil, about the divine and the diabolical\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllegory set in the garden of Eden (biblical context)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sonata has no meaning at all\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonally, I think the fact that Liszt never mentioned any programmatic context, makes this sonata even more special. This way, it appears almost mysterically veiled; giving insight in something that is, ultimately, not depictable by words, only by music.\n\n\nForm\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nNow, I would like to present the Form of this piece which is very complicated.\n\n\nThe sonata unfolds in approximately 30 minutes of unbroken music. While its four distinct movements are rolled into one, the entire work is encompassed within the traditional Classical sonata scheme \u2014 exposition, development, and recapitulation. \n\n\nLiszt has effectively composed a sonata within a sonata, which is part of the work's uniqueness. Liszt was very economical with his thematic material, indeed, the very first page contains the three motivic ideas that provide the content, transformed throughout, for nearly all that follows.\n\n\nLiszt's inspiration\n\n\nIt is likely that Liszt derived the idea of thematic transformation as a unifying process from Schubert\u2019s Wanderer Fantasy, a work which he himself transcribed for piano and orchestra in 1851 (which is a one-movement sonata, and a traditional four-movement sonata the same time). \n\n\nThis is all possible because every single movement is built around the same motif, which is itself derived from the opening phrase of Schubert\u2019s lied Der Wanderer. It\u2019s very clear that it was a source of inspiration for Liszt. Also, just as in the Liszt Sonata, the four movements are played without a break.\n\n\nFormal structure\n\n\n\n\nHere is a table which shows my approximation of the formal structure (although there are many other possibilities as claimed by theorists such as Newman or Winklhofer). Numbers are the Bars, for idea of proportion.\n\n\nHence, this Sonata is one of the first instances of a Double-function form, a musical piece which has two classical forms happening at the same time. Composers like Sch\u00f6nberg later drew inspiration from this.\n\n\nThemes and motifs\n\n\nThis is an appropriate moment to present the themes of the Sonata. The main theme is scattered across the first page (of the Emil von Sauer edition of the Score), which functions as a prologue. \n\n\nThe first part of the theme consists of a double drumbeat (unisono, G) and a descending scale(phrygian and gypsy) , which can be interpreted as a theme on its own.\n\n\nThe second part of the theme consist of a (unisono) octave leap and as a very energetic and strong willed character. Perhaps it is an image of Faust. the third part of the main theme is the hammerblow (quick repetition of notes) which has a very demonic character and could very well represent Mephisto (from Goethe\u2019s \u2018Faust\u2019).\n\n\nBy the way this theme is later transformed into the 2nd Subordinate theme.  Everything in this Sonata is build around these 3 mini-themes.\n\n\nThe epilogue (last page in the Emil von Sauer edition) consist of the same motifs as the prologue but in a different key and in reverse order. This, kind of makes this piece symmetrical and, probably, has a symbolic meaning of returning to the same point (beginning\nending) after a long journey.\n\n\n\n\nTo help make myself clear, here is an overview of the themes and the keys.\n\n\nAnalysis of my favourite passages\n\n\nNext, I would like to show some passages, which are very interesting (macro analysis).\n\n\nRecitativo\n\n\nThe first passage is the Recitativo (from Bar 297). This Recitativo can be seen as the transition from the 1st movement into the 2nd mov. (andante sostenuto). It is made of the 1st Subordinate theme and features very special 3rd relations: C sharp minor 64 chord, A major, A augmented and D major, all the time with G sharp as a pedal point (which really adds a lot of tension).\n\n\nAfter the first Recitativo comes a similar passage (Bar 302): F minor \n D flat major \n D flat augmented and G flat augmented. After that it goes on with the half - whole scale which transitions trough the mephisto theme (bar 319) into the 2nd movement.\n\n\nFugato\n\n\nNow I\u2019d like to write about the Fugato (from Bar 460), which is the transition to the Recapitulation.\n\n\nThe final recapitulatory section is launched by a driving fugato of contrapuntal skill which leads to the compressed return of the opening material. Calling upon every intellectual resource and fully exploiting the pianist's technical arsenal, it is at this point where a performer's concentration might flag. \n\n\nBut this final section has only just begun, and a pianist needs to have reserved fuel in his tank if he is to turn in a successful performance of the sonata. Up to Bar 522 its fugue-like in 3 parts. \n\n\nThe fugato is in B flat minor using motif the 2nd and 3rd motif from the prologue. At one point the fugato subject is turned upside down and presented in counterpoint against itself. \n\n\nThis fugato has a very ironic and diabolic character. Perhaps it is a conversation between Faust and Mephisto? After the fugal entries the fugato modulates enharmonically and moves from a polyphonic to a more homophone texture where the recapitulation is started.\n\n\nEpiloque\n\n\nLast but not least I would like to end with the epilogue. Like I indicated earlier, it consist of the same motifs as the prologue but reharmonised and in reverse order. \n\n\nA very special moment in the final chord progression (Bar 755 and following): A major \n F major \n And B major. F major and B major are located as far as possible form each other in the circle of fifth. \n\n\nThis chord progression has a very special effect and is, probably, one of the most amazing chord progressions in romantic music.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nAs you have, probably, noticed, it is impossible to make a black - white kind of analysis of this sonata, which makes it really interesting.\n\n\nIn my opinion, this music isn\u2019t meant to be nice music in a narrow sense, but it tells a story. It\u2019s up to the performer and the listener to understand it.",
